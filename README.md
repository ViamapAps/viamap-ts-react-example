# Introduction

This project is an example of how Viamap vector maps can be integrated in a React Typescript Application.

The application is not usefull in itself but illustrates:

- import of required npm viamap modules
- specifying your Viamap token and initializing the map
- using native Mapboxgl functionality to add map features
- draving some points on the map
- how to integrate with React components
- how to get events to the map
- how to get events from the map to other parts of the application
- how to show the orthophoto
- simple event handlers

Focus has been on compact code examples
Everything is in the file App.tsx for ease of reading.
